# ADR <nnn>: <Decision Title>

<!-- Example: ADR 011: Thumbnail Extraction Strategy -->

- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded by ADR-xxx
- **Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
- **Authors:** <Claude Code | Team Member Name>
- **Related SPEC:** [SPEC-xxx-feature-name.md](../SPECS/SPEC-xxx-feature-name.md) _(if applicable)_

## Context

**What problem are we solving?**
- Describe the technical or business problem that requires a decision
- Include background information that helps readers understand why this matters
- List specific requirements or constraints that influence the decision

**Example:**
> The upload show page currently displays text-only video cards without visual previews. Users need to see thumbnails for videos because:
> 1. Quickly identify which TikTok content was processed
> 2. Visually confirm correct videos were extracted
> 3. Preview slideshow images before reading text
>
> **Requirements:**
> - Display video thumbnails inline (200x200px)
> - Handle both external and self-extracted frames
> - Graceful fallback if extraction fails

---

## Decision

**What did we decide to do?**
- State the chosen solution clearly and concisely
- Include architecture overview if applicable
- Show code examples or diagrams if helpful

**Example:**
> **We will implement a three-tier thumbnail extraction strategy:**
>
> ### Tier 1: External API (Preferred)
> Try to use thumbnail URL provided by external service
>
> ### Tier 2: Local Extraction (Fallback)
> Extract frame from downloaded file using processing tool
>
> ### Tier 3: Placeholder (Last Resort)
> Display generic icon if both fail
>
> ### Architecture
>
> ```ruby
> class ThumbnailExtractor
>   def call
>     thumbnail_path = if external_thumbnail_available?
>       download_external_thumbnail    # Tier 1
>     else
>       extract_frame_from_file        # Tier 2
>     end
>
>     return show_placeholder unless thumbnail_path  # Tier 3
>     upload_to_storage(thumbnail_path)
>   end
> end
> ```

## Alternatives Considered

**What other options did we evaluate?**

List each alternative with:
- **Approach:** Brief description or code example
- **Pros:** What makes this option attractive
- **Cons:** What are the drawbacks (mark dealbreakers with ❌)
- **Decision:** Why was it rejected or selected (mark selected with ✅)

### Option A: <Name> (Rejected | Selected)

**Approach:**
```
Code example or description
```

**Pros:**
- Fast implementation
- No new dependencies

**Cons:**
- ❌ No fallback if external service fails
- ❌ User sees placeholder for many items

**Decision:** Rejected - too many items would lack thumbnails

---

### Option B: <Name> (Rejected | Selected)

**Approach:**
```
Alternative approach
```

**Pros:**
- Consistent quality
- Full control over output

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires additional processing time
- ❌ Adds external dependency

**Decision:** Rejected - wasteful if external source available

---

### Option C: <Name> (Selected) ✅

**Approach:**
```
The chosen approach
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Best balance of speed and reliability
- ✅ Graceful degradation
- ✅ Maximizes availability

**Cons:**
- More complex implementation
- Additional dependency required

**Decision:** Selected - provides best user experience
