# 70 — Prompting & Context

## Briefs
Keep `project/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` to 1–2 pages: Goal, Constraints, Interfaces, Acceptance Criteria, Risks/Non-goals, Scenarios.

## Retrieval & Citations
Ask Claude to read handbook + brief first and cite sections used.

## Execution Flow
QUESTIONS → SPEC → ADR → TASKS → CHANGE PLAN → CODE+TESTS.  
Use **Autonomy Mode** for iterative build-test loops.


When starting a new project, always produce an IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:
- Summarize goals, scope, and milestones.
- Propose a prioritized roadmap with milestone phases (M1–M3 etc.).
- Group acceptance criteria and tests by milestone.
- Identify open questions and dependencies.
